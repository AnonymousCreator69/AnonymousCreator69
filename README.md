- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? In the 1840s, long before the modern computer was invented, Ada wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is often celebrated as the world's first programmer, and the programming language Ada, created by the U.S. Department of Defense, is named in her honor!
